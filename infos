CREATE SCHEMA is a synonym for CREATE DATABASE. *
An error occurs if the database exists and you did not specify IF NOT EXISTS. *
CREATE DATABASE is not permitted within a session that has an active LOCK TABLES statement. *
Each create_option specifies a database characteristic. Database characteristics are stored in the data dictionary. *
If the database name is omitted, the statement applies to the default database. In that case, an error occurs if there is no default database.*

**A stored routine that uses the database defaults when the routine is created includes those defaults
as part of its definition. (In a stored routine, variables with character data types use the database
defaults if the character set or collation are not specified explicitly. See Section 13.1.17,
“CREATE PROCEDURE and CREATE FUNCTION Statements”.) If you change the default character set or collation
 for a database, any stored routines that are to use the new defaults must be dropped and recreated. **

Enabling READ ONLY affects all users of the database, with these exceptions that are not subject to read-only checks: *

LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements : https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/lock-tables.html

Character Sets, Collations, Unicode : https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/charset.html
SHOW CHARACTER SET Statement : https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/show-character-set.html
SHOW COLLATION Statement : https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/show-collation.html
